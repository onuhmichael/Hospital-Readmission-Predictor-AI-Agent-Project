# üè• Hospital Readmission Synthetic Data Generator

This project provides a **synthetic data generator** for simulating hospital admission and readmission records. It is designed to support **healthcare AI projects**, **data engineering pipelines**, and **machine learning experiments** where realistic, privacy-safe patient data is required.

## üìå Features

- **Continuous Data Streaming**: Generates batches of patient records at configurable time intervals.  
- **Extended Realism**: Includes demographics, clinical details, lifestyle factors, and insurance information.  
- **Customizable Output**: Easily adjust batch size, interval, and output directory.  
- **CSV Export**: Appends new records to a CSV file for downstream use.  
- **Safe & Synthetic**: No real patient data is used‚Äîrecords are fully artificial.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The script includes a configuration section at the top:

```python
OUTPUT_DIR = r"C:\Hospital Readmission Predictor AI Agent Project\HRPA_Data"
OUTPUT_FILE = "hospital_readmission_data.csv"
BATCH_SIZE = 10   # number of records generated every cycle
INTERVAL = 2      # seconds between each batch
```

- **OUTPUT_DIR** ‚Üí Directory where the CSV file will be saved.  
- **OUTPUT_FILE** ‚Üí Name of the CSV file.  
- **BATCH_SIZE** ‚Üí Number of records generated per cycle.  
- **INTERVAL** ‚Üí Time (in seconds) between each batch.

## üìä Data Schema

Each generated record contains the following fields:

| Field                        | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| PatientID                     | Unique patient identifier (UUID-based) |
| Age                           | Patient age (18‚Äì90) |
| Gender                        | Male, Female, or Other |
| AdmissionDate                 | Date of hospital admission |
| DischargeDate                 | Date of discharge |
| Diagnosis                     | Primary diagnosis (e.g., Heart Failure, Diabetes) |
| LengthOfStay                  | Number of days admitted |
| PriorAdmissions               | Count of previous admissions |
| Medications                   | Example prescribed medication |
| ReadmittedWithin30Days        | Target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes) |
| BMI                           | Body Mass Index (18.0‚Äì40.0) |
| SmokingStatus                 | Never, Former, or Current |
| AlcoholUse                    | None, Moderate, or Heavy |
| BloodPressure                 | Systolic/Diastolic (e.g., 120/80) |
| CholesterolLevel              | Cholesterol in mg/dL (150‚Äì300) |
| HbA1c                         | Glycated hemoglobin % (4.5‚Äì12.0) |
| FollowUpAppointmentScheduled  | 0 = No, 1 = Yes |
| InsuranceType                 | Public, Private, or Self-Pay |
| RecordGeneratedAt             | Timestamp of record creation |

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Install dependencies**  
   Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

2. **Run the script**  

   ```bash
   python hospital_readmission_generator.py
   ```

3. **Stop the generator**  
   Press `CTRL + C` to stop streaming data.

## üìÇ Output Example

A sample CSV row might look like:

```csv
PatientID,Age,Gender,AdmissionDate,DischargeDate,Diagnosis,LengthOfStay,PriorAdmissions,Medications,ReadmittedWithin30Days,BMI,SmokingStatus,AlcoholUse,BloodPressure,CholesterolLevel,HbA1c,FollowUpAppointmentScheduled,InsuranceType,RecordGeneratedAt
a1b2c3d4,67,Female,2025-03-15,2025-03-20,Heart Failure,5,2,Beta Blockers,1,29.4,Former,Moderate,135/85,210,7.2,1,Public,2025-09-28 15:20:45
```

## üîß Customization Ideas

- Add **more diagnoses or medications** to expand realism.  
- Introduce **geographic or hospital-specific fields**.  
- Simulate **seasonal admission trends**.  
- Integrate with **streaming platforms** (Kafka, Event Hubs) for real-time pipelines.
