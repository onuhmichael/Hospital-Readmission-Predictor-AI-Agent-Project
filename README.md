# üè• Hospital Readmission Predictor AI Agent

## üìå Project Description
This project is a **proof-of-concept** demonstrating how to build, deploy, and manage an **AI agent** capable of predicting **30-day hospital readmissions**.  

The workflow is designed to run on the **Azure AI Foundry** platform, emphasizing a **minimal, production-minded MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** approach.  

The goal is to create a **practical, end-to-end solution** that:
- Starts with **synthetic data generation**  
- Moves through **model training and deployment**  
- Culminates in an **intelligent agent** for clinical decision support  

This repository serves as both a **comprehensive guide** and a **showcase** for leveraging modern AI platforms to improve **patient outcomes**.

## üéØ Project Goals
The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Establish a Structured Workflow**  
   - Set up a clean, manageable project structure using **GitHub** for version control  
   - Use a **Kanban board** for agile task management  

2. **Generate Realistic Synthetic Data**  
   - Create a synthetic dataset that mimics real-world patient data  
   - Enable model development without compromising patient privacy  

3. **Develop a Predictive Model**  
   - Train and evaluate machine learning models  
   - Start with a simple baseline, then progress to an advanced **XGBoost model**  
   - Predict the likelihood of a patient being readmitted within 30 days of discharge  

4. **Deploy on Azure**  
   - Deploy the trained model as a **real-time, scalable endpoint**  
   - Use **Azure Machine Learning** and **Azure AI Foundry**  

5. **Build an AI Agent**  
   - Construct an AI agent in **Azure AI Foundry**  
   - Integrate the deployed model as a tool  
   - Provide **clear, actionable risk assessments** for clinical decision support  

6. **Showcase and Document**  
   - Thoroughly document every step of the process  
   - Create a valuable reference for building similar AI solutions in healthcare

## üß™ Synthetic Data Generator

The **Hospital Readmission Synthetic Data Generator** is the foundation of this project. It produces realistic, privacy-safe patient records that fuel model training and evaluation.

### üìå Features
- **Continuous Data Streaming**: Generates batches of patient records at configurable time intervals.  
- **Extended Realism**: Includes demographics, clinical details, lifestyle factors, and insurance information.  
- **Customizable Output**: Easily adjust batch size, interval, and output directory.  
- **CSV Export**: Appends new records to a CSV file for downstream use.  
- **Safe & Synthetic**: No real patient data is used‚Äîrecords are fully artificial.  

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
At the top of the script, you can configure:

```python
OUTPUT_DIR = r"C:\Hospital Readmission Predictor AI Agent Project\HRPA_Data"
OUTPUT_FILE = "hospital_readmission_data.csv"
BATCH_SIZE = 10   # number of records generated every cycle
INTERVAL = 2      # seconds between each batch
```

- **OUTPUT_DIR** ‚Üí Directory where the CSV file will be saved  
- **OUTPUT_FILE** ‚Üí Name of the CSV file  
- **BATCH_SIZE** ‚Üí Number of records generated per cycle  
- **INTERVAL** ‚Üí Time (in seconds) between each batch
